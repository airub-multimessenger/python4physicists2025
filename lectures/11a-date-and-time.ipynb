    "- **Temps Atomique International** (TAI) is the actual instrumental time, as measured by atomic clocks. It has no notion of leap seconds so it is always ahead. The `TAI - UTC` difference gives the current number of leap seconds. At some point in the far-far future, TAI will be midnight and UTC will be noon (or maybe not, it seems metrologists are abandoning the leap seconds).\n",

    "- However, if your experimental data only span a few hours or days, it may be more convenient to define your own custom \"zero time\" and use a floating point number (but be careful to check that the accuracy is more than sufficient) for the number of seconds.\n",
    "- **Unfortunately, there is no standard:** `python`, `numpy`, `astropy` and `pandas` have all their own time/timestamp format. For science, `astropy.time` is even more sophisticated than `numpy.datetime64`. Note also that `JSON` does not support writing (serialization) of timestamp out of the box, to save timestamps in a text format you need to define your own (or use an ISO-like as in \"1999-01-01T00:00:00.123456789\")."
